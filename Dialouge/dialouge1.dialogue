Phenix: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], this is the Reborn HQ.  
Phenix: The Reborn are a faction of warriors who use us Ark Drones to raise themselves from the dead.  
Phenix: When a human is raised, they gain elemental powers. You seem to have some great powers.  
Phenix: You were a soldier from World War 3. You probably died in the nuclear apocalypse. Your will to live must be intense if you died so long ago.  
Phenix: Since you are one of us now, you need a code name. How about Paladin?  
- Sure!  
	Phenix: Alright, great. You are now the Paladin.  
- Nah.  
	Phenix: Sorry, I cant think of a better name.

~ reborn_guard  

Reborn Guard: [[Halt.|State your business.|You're entering Reborn territory.]]  
Reborn Guard: If you’re here for trouble, turn back. If you’re here to fight for us, pick up a rifle.  
- I need supplies.  
	Reborn Guard: There are plenty of shops in this base.  
- I want to join the fight.  
	Reborn Guard: Then prove yourself by doing some missions. We don’t take in just anyone.

~ quartermaster  

Quartermaster Rook: [[You need gear?|Looking for weapons?|Don’t waste my time.]]  
Quartermaster Rook: I’ve got what you need, but nothing is free.  
- What do you have?  
	Quartermaster Rook: Guns, armor, energy shields… whatever keeps you breathing. Most of my stuff is standard issue republic weaponry.
- Can I get a discount?  
	Quartermaster Rook: No. All prices are final.

~ reborn_soldier  

Reborn Soldier: [[Hey, newcomer.|First time here?|You look fresh out of the grave.]]  
Reborn Soldier: The fight never stops. We die, we rise, we fight again. That’s the way of the Reborn.  
- What’s the mission?  
	Reborn Soldier: Keep the bandits off our people and take back what’s ours. Simple.  
- Ever been scared to die?  
	Reborn Soldier: Death’s just a pit stop. You get used to it.  

=> END  

~ citizen_mechanic  

Citizen Mechanic: [[Need a tune-up?|Got some cash?|If it moves, I can fix it.]]  
Citizen Mechanic: The Reborn may fight, but I keep their ships running. That’s what matters.  
- Do you have any ships?  
	Citizen Mechanic: Heck yeah I have ships! Just remember, good tech ain’t cheap.  
- Are you an alien?
	Citizen Mechanic: Yes, I am a Tzorian, from the planet Tzora. My species is known for its great intelligence and technology. Our body also glows.
- What do you know about the bandits?  
	Citizen Mechanic: They scavenge, they steal, they kill. They don’t build. That’s why they’ll never win.  

=> END  

~ merchant_scrapper  

Scrapper Merchant: [[Looking to trade?|Got money?|Nothing’s free.]]  
Scrapper Merchant: Scrap for weapons, weapons for survival. That’s how it works here.  
- What’s for sale?  
	Scrapper Merchant: Whatever I could pry from wrecks and dead hands. I can also make custom weapons from scrap parts. 
- Heard any news?  
	Scrapper Merchant: The bandits have taken over an Ark Crystal mine in Antarctica. Means more work for the Reborn.  
- Found anything good while scavenging?  
	Scrapper Merchant: [[A few cell guns, a busted rifle, some ancient datapad with a dead battery.|I found a powerful flamethrower from a bandit. It looks badly made, I would not put fuel in it.|I found a heavy minigun from a bandit juggernaut.]]
- Ever run into bandits?  
	Scrapper Merchant: All the time. I keep my head low and my photon gun ready.  

=> END  

~ citizen_survivor  

Survivor: [[You one of the Reborn?|Here to help?|Are you with them?]]  
Survivor: The bandits took everything. The only reason I'm still breathing is because the Reborn pushed them back.  
- What happened?  
	Survivor: They raided our town in the Sahara Desert. Took supplies, took people… some fought back, but it didn’t end well.  
- Where did they go?  
	Survivor: North, toward the old city ruins of London and the other European cities. They’ll be back, they always come back.  

=> END  



~ citizen_doctor  

Field Doctor: [[You injured?|Need medical supplies?|Try not to bleed out here.]]  
Field Doctor: Keeping the Reborn patched up is a full-time job. Lucky for them, I don’t mind the work.  
- How do you treat the Reborn?  
	Field Doctor: Their Ark Drones handle the big stuff, I deal with the rest.  
- Can an Ark Drone fail to resurrect someone?  
	Field Doctor: If the drone no longer has power, or if someone loses their will to live, then they cannot be resurrected. Such is the fate of many Reborn.  
- How do the Ark Drones work?  
	Field Doctor: Ark Drones use Ark Energy, which has the power to rekindle life itself. You would not understand all the scientific stuff.  

=> END  

~ citizen_historian  

Historian: [[You care about the past?|Looking for answers?|History still matters, you know.]]  
Historian: The Republic abandoned Earth, but that doesn’t mean we should forget what came before.  
- What do you know about the Reborn?  
	Historian: They were an experiment, a secret project created by ancient scientists during World War 3. The scientists were all nuked in the war, but their ark drones survived, and they kept the Reborn alive.  
- What about the bandits?  
	Historian: Most of them are descendants of those left behind. The Republic made them dependent on them, and when they left, they no longer had a purpose.  

=> END  

~ citizen_child  

Child: [[You’re a Reborn?|You don’t look dead.|Are you a robot?]]  
Child: They say you come back when you die. Can you teach me how to do that?  
- It’s not that simple.  
	Child: But you get up after dying, right? I wanna do that too.  
- Stay safe, kid.  
	Child: I will! If the bandits come, I’ll hide real good.  

=> END  

~ reborn_squire_1  

Reborn Squire: [[Hey, you’re the new one, right?|Fresh out of the grave?|You really came back from World War 3?]]  
Reborn Squire: I just started my training. Still getting used to dying and coming back.  
- How’s training going?  
	Reborn Squire: It’s rough. They expect us to fight like we’ve been doing it for years. But I guess that’s what it means to be Reborn.  
- Ever been in real combat?  
	Reborn Squire: Not yet. I’ve fought in drills, but I hear bandits don’t play fair.  
- What happens if you mess up?  
	Reborn Squire: You die. Then you get back up and try again. That’s just how it is.  

=> END  

~ reborn_squire_2  

Reborn Squire: [[You looking for a sparring partner?|Need help with your gear?|Got any advice for a newbie?]]  
Reborn Squire: I want to prove myself, but I’ve died more in training than I want to admit.  
- What’s the hardest part of training?  
	Reborn Squire: The pain. Dying still hurts, even if you come back.  
- Do the Ark Drones ever fail?  
	Reborn Squire: Not usually, but I heard about a Reborn who didn’t wake up once. No one knows why.  
- Why did you join the Reborn?  
	Reborn Squire: I didn’t have a choice. I died, and when I came back, they told me I was one of them now.  

=> END  

~ reborn_knight  

Reborn Knight: [[You carry yourself like a warrior.|Another new recruit?|Are you ready to fight for the Reborn?]]  
Reborn Knight: The bandits outnumber us, but they don’t have what we do. We don’t stay dead.  
- What’s your rank?  
	Reborn Knight: I am a Knight of the Reborn. I lead squads into battle and ensure no one is left behind… at least, no one who can still rise.  
- What’s your opinion on the bandits?  
	Reborn Knight: They fight like scavengers, but don’t underestimate them. They’ve survived longer than most of us have been alive.  
- What happens if an Ark Drone stops working?  
	Reborn Knight: Then you die for real. That’s why we protect them at all costs.  
=> END  

~ cyborg_merchant  

Cyborg Merchant: [[You looking for something special?|Need something powerful?|I don’t sell junk.]]  
Cyborg Merchant: The name’s Vexus. I deal in rare weapons, alien armor, and exotic tech you won’t find anywhere else.  

- What kind of weapons do you sell?  
	Vexus: Advanced alien stuff. Plasma casters, graviton blades, kinetic disruptors. Things that make a real difference in a fight.  
- What about armor?  
	Vexus: Reinforced alien exo-suits, energy shielding, adaptive plating. You want to stay alive longer? You buy from me.  
- Where do you get your stock?  
	Vexus: Salvage, trade, black market… and sometimes, I make them myself. These cybernetics aren’t just for show.  
- You’re a cyborg?  
	Vexus: More machine than human at this point. Flesh is weak. Metal doesn’t break so easily.  
- Ever fought against the bandits?  
	Vexus: Once. I lost an arm and half my face. Now, I sell weapons to make sure others don’t end up like me.  
- Got anything illegal?  
	Vexus: Everything’s illegal somewhere. Good thing no one enforces the law anymore in this time of war.
