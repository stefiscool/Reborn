Phenix: This is the valley of Meggido. Well, not really a valley anymore, so much as an abandoned territory of the GAR.

Phenix: Oh right, GAR stands for Galactic Aerospace Republic. 
Phenix: They are the primary nation of humanity in the galaxy. They own quite a few worlds and are one of the leading galactic superpowers. 
Phenix: By the way, there's a stronger rifle here you should grab. We should be able to fix it up real quick with the crafting table.
